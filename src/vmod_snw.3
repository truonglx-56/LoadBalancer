.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This Varnish module (VMOD) provides functions to create and delete
backends at runtime. This means that backends can be created at any
time while Varnish is running without reloading VCL, and that backends
created by the VMOD can also be deleted by the VMOD at runtime.
.sp
Backends created by the VMOD are the same as backends defined by
static declarations with the \fBbackend\fP keyword, and they have the
same configuration parameters with the same default values. Once
created, a backend can be added to a director or assigned as a value
of \fBreq.backend_hint\fP or \fBbereq.backend\fP\&. Backends created by the
VMOD are accessed by the finder method \fBby_name\fP, using the name
string assigned at creation.
.sp
Once deleted, a backend is no longer in use by Varnish \-\- it is not
selected by any director to which it may have been added, and is no
longer returned by \fBby_name\fP\&.

    # Dynamic backends may be added to directors.

    # Backend creation supports all of the optional configuration
    # parameters available to static backend declarations; these
    # have the same default values as for a static declaration if
    # left unspecified.

.sp
Create a backend with the given configuration. The parameters
correspond to the configuration fields of a static backend
declaration. Further restrictions on required and optional parameters
are given below.
.sp
\fBcreate()\fP returns \fBfalse\fP if backend creation was unsuccessful,
\fBtrue\fP on success. After successful creation, the backend appears in
the output of the CLI command \fBbackend.list\fP, and statistics in the
\fBVBE.*\fP namespace appear in the output of \fBvarnishstat\fP\&. Its
health can be set with the CLI command \fBbackend.set_health\fP\&.
.sp
A backend created by the VMOD is "owned" by the VCL instance in which
it is created, and is not available in any other VCL loaded by the
Varnish process. The backend is deleted when its VCL is discarded, and
it enters the cooldown state when its VCL is set to cold; in
particular, no more health probes for that backend are performed, if
any were defined, when the backend goes cold.
.sp
The parameters may be specified as named parameters in any order. If
used without parameter names, they MUST appear strictly in the order
given in the function signature shown above.
.SS Required Parameters
.sp
The parameters \fBname\fP and \fBhost\fP MUST be non\-empty strings.
\fBname\fP MUST contain only alphanumeric characters or the
underscore. It MAY NOT be a name already used for another backend
created by the VMOD in the current instance of VCL, unless the backend
with the duplicate name has been deleted.
.sp
\fBhost\fP MUST be either an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) or a host name
that can be resolved when \fBcreate\fP is called. A host name may
resolve to both an IPv4 and IPv6 address, but for each address family,
it MUST resolve to exactly one address.
.SS Optional Parameters
.sp
\fBport\fP MUST be a numeric port number, or a TCP service name listed
in \fB/etc/services\fP\&. The default is \fB"80"\fP\&.
.sp
\fBprobe\fP MUST specify a probe defined in a static declaration (or
possibly a probe returned by another VMOD). If left unspecified, the
backend has no probe.
.sp
\fBhost_header\fP MUST be a non\-empty legal value for the \fBHost\fP
header, and is sent as the \fBHost\fP header in backend requests. By
default, the value of the \fBhost\fP parameter is used for \fBHost\fP\&.
.sp
Each of \fBconnect_timeout\fP, \fBfirst_byte_timeout\fP and
\fBbetween_bytes_timeout\fP MUST be a VCL duration, such as \fB0.5s\fP,
\fB1m\fP, etc. If a timeout is set for a specific backend request (using
\fBbereq.connect_timeout\fP, etc.), then that timeout overrides the
setting in the backend definition. If any of these parameters are left
unspecified, then the timeout "hierarchy" is followed as for standard
Varnish \-\- a \fBbereq.*\fP timeout is used if set, otherwise the
corresponding global parameter is used (\fB\-p connect_timeout\fP, etc.).
.sp
\fBmax_connections\fP MUST be an integer. By default, there is no upper
bound for the connections to a backend.
.sp
\fBproxy_header\fP MUST be 0, 1 or 2. If 1 or 2, then that version of
the PROXY protocol is used with the backend; if 0, then the PROXY
protocol is not used. Default is 0.

Return the backend created by the VMOD with the given name in the
current instance of VCL. \fBname\fP MUST be the name of a backend
previously created with \fBcreate()\fP in the current VCL.
.sp
\fBby_name()\fP cannot return a statically declared backend, a backend
deleted by \fBdelete()\fP, a backend owned by another VCL, or a backend
created by another VMOD.
.sp
The function returns \fBNULL\fP if no backend with the given name exists
(or has been deleted). If this happens when setting the value of
\fBreq.backend_hint\fP or \fBbereq.backend\fP, the result is typically a
503 response with the FetchError "No backend found".

Delete the backend created by the VMOD with the given name in the

previously created with \fBcreate()\fP in the current VCL.
.sp
After deletion, a backend is considered unhealthy and hence is o
longer selected for new backend requests. It enters a "cooldown" state
of at least 60 seconds, during which it may complete any requests that
had already begun when it was deleted.  Any current backend requests
MUST be completed during this time. The \fBVBE.*\fP statistics for the
backend continue to appear in the output of \fBvarnishstat\fP during
cooldown, and \fBMAIN.n_backend\fP is not decremented until cooldown
elapses.
.sp
The backend no longer appears in the output of \fBbackend.list\fP after
deletion, and its health cannot be set by \fBbackend.set_health\fP\&. It
is not returned by \fBby_name()\fP, and cannot be used to set the value
of \fBreq.backend_hint\fP or \fBbereq.backend\fP\&. If the backend had been
previously added to a director, it is no longer selected by the
director after deletion.
.sp
\fBdelete()\fP cannot delete a statically declared backend, a backend
that has already been deleted, a backend owned by another VCL, or a
backend created by another VMOD.
.sp
\fBdelete()\fP returns \fBfalse\fP if deletion was unsuccessful, \fBtrue\fP
otherwise.

.SH ERRORS
.sp
If \fBcreate()\fP is called in \fBvcl_init\fP and backend creation fails,
then the VCL program will fail to load, and the VCC compiler will emit
an error message.
.sp
If \fBcreate()\fP is called in any other VCL subroutine and an error
occurs, then an error message will be written to the Varnish log using
the tag \fBVCL_Error\fP, and the function returns false.
.sp
\fBby_name()\fP and \fBdelete()\fP only fail if the specified backend was
not created by the VMOD in the current VCL, or if it was already
deleted. There is no error message.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.sp
This VMOD requires Varnish 5.1. See the source repository for versions
that are compatible with other versions of Varnish.
.SH INSTALLATION
.sp
See \fI\%INSTALL.rst\fP in the source repository.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
\fBcreate()\fP prevents the use of duplicate backend names created by
this VMOD in the current instance of VCL, but it cannot prevent the
re\-use of a backend name created by other means, for example by a
static declaration or another VMOD. Varnish has no problem using
backends with duplicate names, since they are represented internally
as distinct objects. But if two backends have the same name, they
appear as duplicate entries in the output of \fBbackend.list\fP; and if
one of them is sick while the other is healthy, it is impossible to
tell which is which. Also, \fBVBE.*\fP stats are maintained for only one
of the backends with that name. So you should take care not to create
backends with names used elsewhere in the VCL.
.sp
\fBby_name()\fP searches for backends in a linear list, and is locked
out of the search if \fBcreate()\fP or \fBdelete()\fP are executing
concurrently. If you have a large number of dynamic backends, it
is probably more efficient to add them to directors (even a director
that has only one backend) than to set \fBreq.backend_hint\fP or
\fBbereq.backend\fP using \fBby_name()\fP, since a director does not
execute the linear search.
.sp
It is in the nature of dynamic backends that they are not preserved
when Varnish stops or when the VCL is discarded. While dynamic
backends make it possible to change the backend configuration without
reloading VCL, you may nevertheless want to update your backend
configuration in VCL sources on the file system, so that your backends
are not "lost" on restart.
